# Day 1

## 1. Python Installation
- **Download Python:** Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).
- **Install Python:** Run the downloaded file and check "Add Python to PATH" during installation to make it accessible from the command line.

## 2. IDE Setup
- **What’s an IDE?** It’s a tool for writing and running code.
- **Beginner IDEs:**
  - **IDLE:** Comes with Python installation. Easy for starters.
  - **VS Code:** Free and customizable. Install Python extension for extra features.
  - **PyCharm:** Beginner-friendly but has more advanced tools.

## 3. Basic Syntax
- **Hello World:**
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
- **Indentation:** Python uses spaces or tabs to define blocks of code. For example:
  ```python
  if 5 > 2:
      print("5 is greater than 2")
  ```
- **Comments:** Use `#` for comments. Example:
  ```python
  # This is a comment
  print("Python is fun")
  ```

## 4. Data Types
- **Numbers:**
  - Integer: `x = 5`
  - Float: `y = 3.14`
- **Strings:**
  ```python
  name = "John"
  print(name)
  ```
- **Booleans:**
  ```python
  is_happy = True
  ```
- **Lists:** Collection of items.
  ```python
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  ```
- **Dictionaries:** Key-value pairs.
  ```python
  person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
  ```
- **Tuples:** Immutable lists.
  ```python
  coordinates = (10, 20)
  ```
- **Sets:** Unique items.
  ```python
  colors = {"red", "blue", "green"}
  ```

## Challenge: 
Write a program that prints a greeting, prompts user input, and displays data types.
